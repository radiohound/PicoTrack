# PicoTrack

PicoTrack uses one of the smallest combined mcu/LoRa transmitter module that is currently available. Currently testing is being done with development boards (Ebyte's E77 dev board 400 mhz version, and Watterott's CAM-M8Q breakout board). In the future, a small, light board that holds these modules will be made. There is a lot of room for lightening this up. The two modules together weigh in at about 1.3 grams!

I have used plenty of LightTracker 1.1 433MHz open source code, as well as some example code from different libraries.

**Important :** 433 MHz may require an amateur radio license to operate if 433 MHz is not ISM band in your country. So check regulations before using it.
